# Chapter 17 - The Justice of God

### Thoughts on the chapter?
### What stuck out to you?
### What did you learn?
  
* “Judgment is the application of equity to moral situations and may be favorable or unfavorable according to whether the one under examination has been equitable or in- equitable in heart and conduct.”
* “God is His own self-existent principle of moral equity, and when He sentences evil men or rewards the righteous, He simply acts like Himself from within, uninfluenced by anything that is not Himself.”
* “God’s being is unitary; it is not composed of a number of parts working harmoniously, but simply one.”

### Outside Texts
* Romans 9:20-21

	20 But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?” 21 Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?

* Job 40:1-9

	In this interaction God replies to Job’s questioning God’s righteousness with his dealings with Job:
	
	40 And the Lord said to Job:
2 “Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
    He who argues with God, let him answer it.”
Job Promises Silence
3 Then Job answered the Lord and said:
4 “Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you?
    I lay my hand on my mouth.
5 I have spoken once, and I will not answer;
    twice, but I will proceed no further.”
The Lord Challenges Job
6 Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
7 “Dress for action like a man;
    I will question you, and you make it known to me.
8 Will you even put me in the wrong?
    Will you condemn me that you may be in the right?
9 Have you an arm like God,
    and can you thunder with a voice like his?
    
* Grudem

	“God’s righteousness means that God always acts in accordance with what is right and is himself the final standard of what is right”
(Systematic Theology pg. 204)

### What does recognition of our own sin gain us?

* “Such men as David and Daniel acknowledged their own un-righteousness in contrast to the righteousness of God, and as result their penitential prayers gained great power and effectiveness.” 

* Luke 18:9-14

	9 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ 13 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ 14 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

### Are there things that you question God’s righteousness or rather just don’t understand it?

* What about people who never hear the gospel?
* What about horrible atrocities?
* Ultimately we have to come back to the same answer…

### Does God still bring down judgement in the physical world (e.g. punishing people through acts of nature)?  Is there any reason to believe either way?

### It is important to not miss the point that sinners who receive God’s mercy are still operating inside of his justice through Christ


# Chapter 18 The Mercy of God  


### Thoughts on the chapter?
### What stuck out to you?
### What did you learn?

* “But we who were one time enemies and alienated in our minds through wicked works shall then see God face to face and His name shall be in our foreheads. We who earned banishment shall enjoy communion; we who deserve the pains of hell shall know the bliss of heaven. And all through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us."
* “We should banish from our minds forever the common but erroneous notion that justice and judgment characterize the God of Israel, while mercy and grace belong to the Lord of the Church. Actually there is in principle no difference between the Old Testament and the New.”
* “If we could remember that the divine mercy is not a temporary mood but an attribute of God’s eternal being, we would no longer fear that it will someday cease to be.”

### Outside Texts
* Exodus 33:19
	
	And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The Lord.’ And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.

* Proverbs 28:13

	Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
    but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.

* Grudem

	“God’s mercy means God’s goodness toward those in misery and distress.” (Systematic Theology pg 200)
	
### Mercy and Grace
* Mercy: Not getting what you do deserve (e.g. withheld punishment)
* Grace: Getting what you don't deserve (e.g. unmerited favor)
* In salvation we can find both mercy and grace, we don’t get the punishment of hell through the forgiveness of sin (mercy) and we gain Christ’s righteousness (grace) which allows us to dwell with God forever in heaven

### Does God require faith to receive mercy?  Is this just talking about saving faith?
* “And of Israel in the wilderness the Hebrew writer says, “But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.” To receive mercy we must first know that God is merciful. And it is not enough to believe that He once showed mercy to Noah or Abraham or David and will again show mercy in some happy future day. We must believe that God’s mercy is boundless, free and, through Jesus Christ our Lord, available to us now in our present situation.”
* James 2:13

	For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
	
* Mathew 5:7

	Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
	
### When was a time that you felt that God showed mercy towards you (other than salvation)?  


# Chapter 23 The Open Secret

### Thoughts on the chapter?
### What stuck out to you?
### What did you learn?

* “But this knowledge is difficult because there are conditions to be met and the obstinate nature of fallen man does not take kindly to the”
* “Second, there must be an utter committal of the whole life to Christ in faith. This is what it means to “believe in Christ.” It involves a volitional and emotional attachment to Him accompanied by `a firm purpose to obey Him in all things`.”
* “Fifth, we must practice the art of long and loving meditation upon the majesty of God. This will take some effort, for the concept of majesty has all but disappeared from the human race.”
* “We may also need to break quietly and graciously with the lifeless textualism that prevails among the gospel churches, and to protest the frivolous character of such that passes for Christianity among us. By this we may for the time lose friends and gain a passing reputation for being holier-than-thou; but no man who permits the expectation of unpleasant consequences to influence him in a matter like this is fit for the kingdom of God.”
* “Thus far we have considered the individual’s personal relation to God, but like the ointment of a man’s right hand, which by its fragrance “betrayeth itself”, any intensified knowledge of God will soon begin to affect those around us in the Christian community. And we must seek purposefully to share our increasing light with the fellow members of the household of God.”
* “There is a glorified Man on the right hand of the Majesty in heaven faithfully representing us there. We are left for a season among men; let us faithfully represent Him here.”

### Where are we at? Is this list too lofty? To idealistic? Spot on?
